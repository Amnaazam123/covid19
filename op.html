				<br>The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica.
			</div>
			<div class="col-4">
				<br>But the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it's also an unprecedent socio-economic crisis. Stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political effects that will leave deep and longstanding scars. UNDP is the technical lead in the UN’s socio-economic recovery, alongside the health response, led by WHO, and the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and working under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinators.
			</div>
			<div class="col-4">
				<br>Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 195 million jobs could be lost.The World Bank projects a US$110 billion decline in remittances this year, which could mean 800 million people will not be able to meet their basic needs.

			It will require all of society to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to cushion the potentially devastating impact it may have on vulnerable people and economies.
			We must rebuild trust and cooperation, within and among nations, and between people and their governments.
			UNDP’s support will also help ensure that the responses of individual countries are comprehensive as well as equitable and inclusive, so that no one is left out and countries can continue to make progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. 
			While we do this, we must also consider ways to prevent a similar pandemic recurring. In the longer term, UNDP will look at ways to help countries to better prevent and manage such crises and ensure that the world makes full use of what we will learn from this one.
			An integrated global response is an investment in our future.<br><br><br><br></p>

    			<h2>Wash your hands often</h2>
<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have<br> been in a public place, or after blowing your<br>
nose, coughing, or sneezing.It’s especially important to wash:<br>
Before eating or preparing food<br>

After using the restroom<br>
After leaving a public place<br>
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing<br>
After handling your mask<br>
After changing a diaper<br>
After caring for someone sick<br>
After touching animals or pets<br>
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60%<br> alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and<br>
rub them together until they feel dry.<br>
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>

    			<h2>Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others</h2>

    			<p>
You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.<br>
The mask is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.<br>
Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in your<br> household, especially when other social <br>
distancing measures are difficult to maintain.<br>
Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or<br> is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise<br> 
unable to remove the mask without assistance.<br>
Do NOT use a mask meant for a healthcare worker. Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators<br> are critical supplies that should be reserved<br>
for healthcare workers and other first responders.<br>
Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The mask is not a substitute for<br> social distancing.</p>
